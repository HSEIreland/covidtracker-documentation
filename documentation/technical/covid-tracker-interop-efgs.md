COVID Tracker has received funding from the EU to support interoperability with other EU digital contact tracing apps. 
To exploit the full potential of contact tracing and warning apps to break the chain of coronavirus infections across borders and save lives, the Commission, at the invitation by EU Member States, has set up an EU-wide system to ensure interoperability – a so-called ‘gateway'. After a successful pilot phase, the system went live OCT 2020.
